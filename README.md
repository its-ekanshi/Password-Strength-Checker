# Password Strength Checker 🔒

## 📌 Project Overview
This **Password Strength Checker** is a Python-based tool designed to assess the strength of a given password based on predefined security conditions. The program helps users create strong passwords by enforcing best practices such as including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

## 🚀 Features
- Checks password length (minimum 8 characters).
- Ensures inclusion of at least one uppercase and one lowercase letter.
- Verifies the presence of at least one digit.
- Encourages the use of special characters for better security.
- Provides real-time feedback on password strength.
- User-friendly loop allowing multiple password checks until exit.

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. The user enters a password.
2. The script evaluates the password against security criteria.
3. Based on the evaluation, it returns:
   - **Weak:** Missing key security elements.
   - **Medium:** Almost secure but missing a special character.
   - **Strong:** Meets all security criteria.
4. The user can continue testing passwords or exit the tool.

### 🔍 Example Outputs
#### **Input:** `P@ssword123`
#### **Output:**
```
Strong: Your password is secured!
```

#### **Input:** `password`
#### **Output:**
```
Weak: password must contain a digit
```
